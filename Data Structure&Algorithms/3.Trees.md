#### Trees

Search : worst case O(log n)

---

##### Preliminaries

A tree is a collection of nodes. Naturally defined **recursively**. 

Denote it as A when the collection is empty.

Else, it consists of a distinguished node r, called the **root**, and zero or more (sub)trees T<sub>1</sub> , T<sub>2</sub> , ... , T<sub>k</sub> , each of whose roots are connected by a directed edge to r.

**Leaves**: No children              **Siblings**: Same Parent

The *length* of *path* from node n<sub>1</sub> to n<sub>k</sub> is k-1, exactly one path from root to each node.

**Depth**: length of path to root 		**Height**: The longest path to a leaf

Depth of a tree == Height of a tree == Depth of the depth of the deepest leaf == Height of root

If there is a path from n<sub>1</sub> to n<sub>2</sub> , then n<sub>1</sub> is an **ancestor** of n<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> is a **descendant** of n<sub>1</sub>.

If n<sub>1</sub> != n<sub>2</sub> , n<sub>1</sub> is an **proper ancestor** of n<sub>2</sub> and n<sub>2</sub> is a **proper descendant** of n<sub>1</sub>.

###### 	Implementation of Tress	

```c
typedef struct tree_node *tree_ptr;
struct tree_node 
{
    element_type element;
    tree_ptr first_child;
    tree_ptr next sibling;
};
```

	###### 	Tree Traversals with an Application

Use in directory structure in many common OS, include *UNIX*, *VAX/VMX*, *DOS*.

```c
void list_directory (Directory_or_file D)
{
	list_dir (D,0);
}

void list_dir (Directory_or_file D, unsigned int depth)
{
/*1*/	if (D is a legitimate entry) 	
	{
/*2*/		print_name (depth,D);			/*excuted once per node*/
/*3*/		if (D is a directory)			/*excuted once per node*/
/*4*/			for each child, c, of D 
/*5*/				list_dir(c,depth+1);	/*executed at most once for each child of 												each node.*/
	}
}
```

***Routine to list a directory in a hierarchical file system**

O(n) for n files to be output

This strategy is *Preorder* traversal, where work at a node is performed before its children are processed.



```c
unsigned int size_directory(Directory_or_file D)
{
    unsigned int total size = 0;
    if (D is a legetimate entry)
    {
        total_size = file_size(D);
        if(D is a directory)
        {
            for each child, c, of D
                total_size += size_directory(c);
        }
    }
    return total_size;
}
```

***Routine to calculate the size of a directory**

This is *postorder* traversal, the work at a node is performed after its children are evaluated.

---

##### Binary Tress

A tree which no node can have more than two children.

Average depth < n, namely $O(\sqrt{n}$) .

For Binary Search Tree, average depth = $O(log n)$.

Worst case, depth = $n-1$

###### 	Implementation

​	Similar to double linked list

```c
typedef struct tree_node *tree_ptr;
struct tree_node
{
    element_type element;
    tree_ptr left;
    tree_ptr right;
};
typedef tree_ptr TREE;
```

***Binary tree node declarations**

Insert:malloc      delete:free

binary trees with n nodes required $n+1$ *NULL* pointers

###### 	Expression Trees (not binary)

The leaves of an expression tree are *operands*, such as constants or variable name. The other nodes contain *operators*.

Left-->node-->right      ==   *Inorder* traversal strategy     produces a **parenthesized right expression**

*Postorder* traversal produces **postfix representation**

*Preorder* traversal produces prefix notation  (P.S. less usful)

​		**Constructing an Expression Tree**

An algorithm to convert a postfix expression into an expression tree.

e.g. Input is  **a b + c d e + * ***

Create a one-node tree for each operand, and push them into a stack, pop two trees and merge them when a new tree is formed and push the pointer to the new tree into the stack.

##### The Search Tree ADT-Binary Search Tree

Important application of binary tree is their use in searching.

Q: What makes binary tree a binary search tree?

A: For every node X, the values of all keys in the **left** sub tree are **smaller** than key values in X, the values of all keys in the **right** sub tree are **larger** than key values in X.

```c
typedef struct tree_node *tree_ptr;
struct tree_node
{
    element_type element;
    tree_ptr left;
    tree_ptr right;
};
typedef tree_ptr SEARCH_TREE;
```

*** Binary search tree declarations**

###### Operations on binary search tree

- make_null

  Mainly for initialization

  ```c
  SEARCH_TREE make_null()
  {
      return NULL;
  }
  ```

- Find

  Return a pointer to the node in tree T that has Key x, or *NULL* if no such node.

  ```c
  tree_ptr find(element_type x,SEARCH_TREE T)
  {
      //Empty test must perform first 
      if (T == NULL)
          return NULL;
      if (x < T->element)
          return (find(x,t->left));
      if (x > T->element)
          return (find(x,t->right));
      else
          return T;
  }
  /* This is an example of tail recursion, which the last step before return calls the function itself, this prevents stack overflow as it only needs the stack for this level, but not with all the previous levels.
  */
  
  /*Python and JAVA should replace normal recursion with iteration, if tail recursion is not possible
  */
  ```

- Find_min and find_max

  To be consistent with find operation, these operations also return the value of position rather than element.

  ```c
  //Recursive Implementation
  tree_ptr find_min(SEARCH_TREE T)
  {
      if (T == NULL)
          return NULL;
      if (T->left != NULL)
          return (find_min(T->left));
      else
          return T;
  }
  //non-recursive Implementation
  tree_ptr find_max(SEARCH_TREE T)
  {
      if (T != NULL)
          while(T->right != NULL)
              T = T->right;
      return T;
  }
  ```

- Insert

  1. Try to find x in T (Duplicated handled by adding an extra field in the node indicating the frequency)
  2. Insert x at the last path traversed

  ```c
  tree_ptr insert(element_type x, SEARCH_TREE T)
  {
      if (T==NULL)
      {
          T = (SEARCH_TREE) malloc (sizeof(struct tree_node));
          if (T==NULL)
              fatal_error("Out of Space!!!");
          else
              T->element = x;
          	T->left = NULL;
          	T->right = NULL;
      }
      else
      {
          if (x<T->element)
              return insert(x,T->left);
          else if (x>T->element)
              return insert(x,T->right);
          else
              //x is already in the tree, do nothing or update something
      }      
      	 return T;
  }
  ```

- Delete

  - leaf: Delete directly

  - node with one child:its parent adjust its pointer to its children 

  - node with two children: replace the key with the smallest key of the right subtree

    If the number of deletions is expected to be small, use **lazy deletion**: left it in the tree and mark it as deleted, if duplicate keys are present,decrement the frequency

  ```c
  tree_ptr delete(element_type x, SEARCH_TREE T)
  {
      tree_ptr tmp_cell,child;
      if (T == NULL)
          error("Element not found");
      else
      {
          if (x < T->element)
              T->left = delete(T->left);
          else if (x > T->element)
              T->right = delete(T->right);
          else /*found the lement to be deleted*/
              if (T->left && T->right) /*two children*/
              {
                  /*replace with smallest in right subtrees*/
                  temp_cell = find_min(T->right);
                  T->element = temp_cell->element;
                  T->right = delete (T->element,T->right);                
              }
          	else 
              {
                  tmp_cell = T;
                  if(T->left == NULL)
                      child = T->right;
                  if(T->right == NULL)
                      child = T->left;
                  free(tmp_cell);
                  return child;
              }
          return T;
      }
  }
  //to be tested, seems like it does not consider the leaf case
  ```

- Average-Case Analysis

  All operation takes $O(\log n)$ as average depth over all nodes is  $O(\log n)$ assuming all trees are equally likely.

  **Internal path length**: sum of depths of all nodes in a tree , let it be $D(n)$

  if i-node of left subtrees:

  $D(n) = D(i)+D(n-i-1)+n-1$

  solving this yields $D(n)=O(n \log n)$

##### AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a binary search tree with a balance condition.

Its balance must be easy to maintain, and ensures the depth of the tree is $O(\log n)$.

- Require left and right subtrees to have the same height -->does not force the tree to be shallow

- Every node must have left and right subtrees of same height --> too rigid to be useful

An AVL tree is identical to a binary search tree, except that for every node in the tree, the height of the left and right subtrees can differ by **at most 1**.

All tree operations can be performed in $O(\log n)$ , except possibly insertion. if lost balance, need **rotation**

###### Single Rotation

```c
//An AVL tree node
typedef struct Node *tree_ptr;
struct Node 
{ 
    element_type element; 
    tree_ptr left; 
    tree_ptr right; 
}; 
typedef tree_ptr SEARCH TREE;

//Right Rotate subtree T
tree_ptr right_rotate(tree_ptr T)
{
    tree_ptr TL = T->left;
    tree_ptr TLR = TL->right;
    
    //perform rotation
    TL->right = T;
    T->left = TLR;
    
    return TL;
}

//Left Rotate subtree T
tree_ptr left_rotate(tree_ptr T)
{
    tree_ptr TR = T->right;
    tree_ptr TRL = TL->left;
    
    //perform rotation
    TR->left = T;
    T->right = TRL;
    
    return TR;
}
//rotation takes constant time
```

###### Double Rotation

```c
//Left Right Rotate subtree T
double_rotate_left(tree_ptr T)
{
	T->left = right_rotate(T->left);
	return left_rotate(T);
}
//Right left Rotate subtree T
double_rotate_left(tree_ptr T)
{
	T->right = left_rotate(T->right);
	return right_rotate(T);
}

```

###### Insertion

```c
SEARCH_TREE insert( element_type x, SEARCH_TREE T )
{
	return insert1( x, T, NULL );
}
SEARCH_TREE insert1( element_type x, SEARCH_TREE T, tree_ptr parent )
{
    tree_ptr rotated_tree;
    if( T == NULL )
    { /* Create and return a one-node tree */
        T = (SEARCH_TREE) malloc ( sizeof (struct avl_node) );
        if( T == NULL )  
            fatal_error("Out of space!!!");    
        else
        {
            T->element = x; T->height = 0;
            T->left = T->right = NULL;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        if( x < T->element )
        {
            T->left = insert1( x, T->left, T );
            if( ( height( T->left ) - height( T->right ) ) == 2) 
            {
                if( x < T->left->element ) rotated_tree = single_left_rotate( T );
                else rotated_tree = double_left_rotate( T );
                
                if ( parent->left == T ) parent->left = rotated_tree;
                else parent->right = rotated_tree;
            }
            else
            {
                T->height = max( height(T->left), height(T->right) ) + 1;
            }              
    	}
        else
        {
            /* Symmetric Case for right subtree */;
			/* Else x is in the tree already. We'll do nothing */
        }
        return T;
}
```

```pseudocode
IF tree is right heavy 
{   
	IF tree's right subtree is left heavy   
	{      
		Perform Double Left rotation    
	}
	ELSE   
	{      
		Perform Single Left rotation   
	}
}
ELSE IF tree is left heavy 
{   
	IF tree's left subtree is right heavy   
	{      
		Perform Double Right rotation   
	}
	ELSE   
	{     
		Perform Single Right rotation   
	}
} 
```



EFFICIENCY NOTE: 

- non-recursive version >> recursive version
- store difference in heights only need 2 bits -> does not worth the loss of clarity and relative simplicity
- Delete is more complicated than insertion, *Lazy deletion* better if deletions are relatively infrequent

##### Splay Trees

Guarantees any m consecutive tree operations take at most $O(m\log n)$ time.

Possible for worst case (per operation) > $O(\log n)$.

Amortized cost per operation:$O(\log n)$

It is common for BST to have a whole sequence of bad accesses, while Splay Tress no bad sequences.

The basic idea of the splay tree is that after a node is accessed, it is **pushed to the root by a series of AVL tree rotations.**

- practically a node being accessed is likely to be accessed again in the near future
- No need maintenance of height or balance information

###### A Simple Idea(That does not work)

Perform rotations bottom up, rotate every nod eon the access path with its parents.

###### Splaying

**Talk is cheap, show me the code!!**

```c
typedef struct splay_node *splay_tree;
struct splay_node
{
    element_type element;
    splay_ptr left;
    splay_ptr right;
    splay_ptr parent;
}
//Can differnt tree_ptr all defined as SEARCH_TREE in same file?
typedef splay_ptr SEARCH_TREE;

//Basic splay routine
void splay(splay_ptr current)
{
    splay_ptr father;
    father = current->parent;
    while (father != NULL)
    {
        if (father->parent == NULL)
            single_rotate(current);
        else
            double_rotate(current);
        father = current->parent;
    }
}
//single rotation
void single_rotate( splay_ptr x )
{
	if( x->parent->left == x)
		zig_left( x );
	else
		zig_right( x );
}
//Single rotation between root and its left child
void zig_left( splay_ptr x )
{
    splay_ptr p, B;
    p = x->parent;
    B = x->right;
    x->right = p; /* x's new right child is p*/
    x->parent = NULL; /* x will now be a root */
    if( B != NULL )
    {
        B->parent = p;
        p->left = B;
        p->parent = x;
    }
}

//Routine to perform a zig-zig when both children are initially left children
void zig_zig_left( splay_ptr x )
{
    splay_ptr p, g, B, C, ggp;
    p = x->parent;
    g = p->parent;
    B = x->right;
    C = p->right;
    ggp = g->parent;
    x->right = p; /* x's new right child is p*/
    p->parent = x;
    p->right = g; /* p's new right child is g */
    g->parent = p;
    if( B != NULL ) /* p's new left child is subtree B */
    {
        B->parent = p;
        p->left = B;
    }
    if( C != NULL ) /* g's new left child is subtree C */
    {
        C->parent = g;
        g->left = C;
        x->parent = ggp; /* connect to rest of the tree */
    }
    if( ggp ! = NULL )
    {
    	if( gpp->left == g )
    		ggp->left = x;
    	else
    		ggp->right = x;
    }
}
```

##### Tree Traversals Revisited

- Inorder Traversal and running time $O(n)$

```c
//Routine to print a binary search tree in order
//each node is visited once and the work done per node is constant
void print_tree( SEARCH_TREE T )
{
	if( T != NULL )
    {
        print_tree( T->left );
        print_element( T->element );
        print_tree( T->right );
    }
}
```

- Postorder traversal and running time $O(n)

  process both subtrees before process a node

```c
int height( TREE T)
{
    if (T==NULL)
        return -1;
    else
        return (max(height(T->left),height(T->right))+1);
}
```

- Preorder traversal

  Node processed before children

  e.g. label each label with its depth

- level-order traversal

  All nodes at depth d are processed before any node at depth d+1

  Not recursive: Queue instead of stack of recursion.

##### B-Trees

A B-tree of order m is a tree with the following properties:

- The root is either a leaf or has between 2 and m children
- All non-leaf nodes (except root) have between$\lceil m/2 \rceil$ and $m$ children
- All leaves are at the same depth
