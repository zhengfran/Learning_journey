##### Recursion:

1. Must have **base cases**, which can be resolved without recursion
2. Making progress, the recursive call must always **make progress** toward a base case
3. **Design Rule**. Assume that all the recursive calls work
4. **Compound Interest Rule**. Never duplicate work by solving the same instance of a problem in separate recursive calls

##### Algo Analysis

###### Math Background

4 Definitions to establish a relative order among functions:

1. Define a lower bound function of f(n)
2. Define an upper bound function of f(n)
3. Define a function with same growth rate of f(n)
4. Define a lower bound function of f(n) exclude the boundary scenario

###### Model

<u>Reading the data is generally the bottleneck</u>

Assume every operation takes the same time - not true

Assume infinite memory - page faulting can be a real problem

###### Running Time Calculations

General Rules:

- The running time of **a loop** is at most the running time of the statement inside the for loop times the number of iterations
- The total running time of a statement inside a group of **nested for loops** is the running time of the statement multiplied by the product of sizes of all the for loops
- **Consecutive statements** just add
- The running time of an **if/else** statement is never more than the running time of the test plus the larger of the running times of S1 and S2
