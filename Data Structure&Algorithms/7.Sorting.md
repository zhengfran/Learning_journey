#### Sorting

Assumptions: 

- Only integers
- Size small enough to do in main memory (otherwise it is external sorting)

Conclusion:

- There are several easy algorithms to sort in O(n<sup>2</sup>), such as insertion sort

- Shellsort is simple to code, runs in o(n<sup>2</sup>), and is efficient in practice
- There are slightly more complicated O(nlogn) sorting algorithms
- Any general-purpose sorting algorithm requires at least O(nlogn) 

##### Preliminaries

N elements, actual data start from index 1.

##### Insertion Sort

###### The Algorithm

Consists of n-1 passes,For pass p = 2 through n, insertion sort ensures that the elements in positions 1 through p are in sorted order.

```c
void insertion_sort(input_type a[],unsigned int n){
    unsigned int j,p;
    input_type tmp;
    	a[0]= MIN_DATA; //sentinel
    	for (p=2;p<=n;p++)
        {
            temp = a[p];
            for (j=p;a[j-1]>temp;j--)
                a[j] = a[j-1];
            a[j] = tmp;
        }
    
}
```

###### Analysis of Insertion Sort

Bound of O(n<sup>2</sup>) and best case of O(n), average case of O(n<sup>2</sup>) .

##### Lower bound for Simple Sorting Algorithms

An *inversion* in an array of numbers is any ordered pair (i,j) having the property that i<j but a[i]>a[j]. The number of inversions is exactly the number of swaps needed to be done by insertion sort. Running time is then `O(I+n)`

THEOREM 7.1.

> The average number of inversions in an array of n distinct numbers is n(n-1)/4.

THEOREM 7.2.

>Any algorithm that sorts by exchanging adjacent elements requires O(n<sup>2</sup>) time on average.

##### Shellsort

It works by comparing elements that are distant;
