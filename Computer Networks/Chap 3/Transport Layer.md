### Transport Layer

- Relationship between the transport and network layers
- how two entities can communicate reliably over a medium that may lose and corrupt data
- controlling  the  transmission  rate  of  transport-layer  entities  in  order  to  avoid,  or recover from, congestion within the network. 

#### 3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services

A transport-layer protocol provides for **logical communication** between application processes running on different hosts.

Application processes use the *logical communication* provided by the transport layer to send messages to each other, *free from the worry of the details* of the physical infrastructure used to carry these messages.

Transport layer protocols are implemented in the **end systems** but not in network routers.

- Receive application layer messages
- Break into small chunks and add transport layer header to each chunk, known as **segments**
- passes the segment to the network layer at the sending end system, segment is encapsulated within a network-layer packet (a **datagram**) 

##### 3.1.1 Relationship between Transport and Network Layers

 Transport-layer  protocol  provides  logical  communication  between *processes running  on  different hosts*.

Network-layer  protocol  provides  logical communication between *hosts*.

Within an end system, a transport protocol moves messages from application processes to the network edge(that is, the network layer) and vice versa, but it doesnâ€™t have any say about how the messages are moved within the network core.

##### 3.1.2 Overview of the Transport Layer in the Internet

- UDP: unreliable, connectionless service 

- TCP: reliable, connection-oriented service

Transport-layer packet is a **segment**. 

The IP service model is a **best-effort delivery service**, also **unreliable service.**

Extending host-to-host delivery to process-to-process delivery is called **transport-layer multiplexing** and **demultiplexing**. 

- UDP services

  - process-to-process  data  deliver

  - error checking

- TCP services(In addition to UDP)

  - congestion control
  - flow control
