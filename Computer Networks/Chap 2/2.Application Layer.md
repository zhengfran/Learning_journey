### Application Layer

- Define key application-layer concepts
- Examine several network application in detail
- network application development

#### 2.1 Principles of Network Applications

Core of network application development is writing programs that run on different end systems and communicate with each other over the network.

For example , in Web, there are:

- the browser program running in the user's host
- the Web server program running in the Web server host

Another example, P2P: there is a program in each host that participates in the file-sharing community, the programs in the various hosts may be similar or identical

##### 2.1.1 Network Application Architectures

Distinctly different from an network's architecture.

Two predominant architectural paradigms:

- client-server architecture

  - Server: Always-on host
  - Clients: send  requests to server

  Characteristics:

  - clients do not directly communicate with each other
  - Server has a fixed, well-know address called UP address

  E.g. Web, FTP. Telnet, email

  A single-server host is often incapable of keeping up with all requests from clients. Thus, a **data center**, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server.

- peer-to-peer(P2P) architecture 

  Minimal or no reliance on data centers, by exploiting direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, name *peers*. 

  E.g. file sharing(BitTorrent), peer assisted download acceleration(Xunlei), Internet Telephony(Skype), and IPTV(PPstream)

  Pros:

  - **Self-scalability**
  - **Cost-effective**

  Challengers:

  - **ISP Friendly**. P2P shift upstream traffic from servers to residential ISPs, while they have been dimensioned for "asymmetrical" bandwidth usage. (Downstream > Upstream)
  - **Security**. Highly distributed and open in nature
  - **Incentives**. Depends on convincing users to volunteer bandwidth, storage, and computation resources to applications.

Some have **hybrid** architectures, combing both client-server and P2P.

e.g. instant messaging applications, servers are used to track IP address of users, but user-to-user messages are sent directly between user hosts

##### 2.1.2 Process Communicating

In OS, it is not programs but **processes** that communicate.

Processes on 2 different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging messages across the computer network.

###### Client and Server Processes

A network application consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a  network.

e.g. With  the  Web,  a browser is a client process and a Web server is a server process. With P2P file-sharing, the peer that is downloading the file is labeled as the client, and the peer that is uploading the file is labeled as the server.

Definition of client and server processes:

> In the context of a communication session between a pair of processes, the process that initiates the communication( that is, initially contacts the other process at the beginning of the session) is labeled as the **client**. The process that waits to be contacted to gebin the session is the **server**.

###### The Interface Between the Process and the Computer Network

A process sends message into, and receives messages from, the network through a software interface called a **socket**.

Socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host, also referred as **Application Programming Interface(API)** between the application and the network.

Application develop control everything of the application layer-side but little of transport-layer side. Only exceptions:

1. The choice of transport protocol
2. Fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and minimum segment sizes 

###### Addressing Processes

In order to  identify the receiving process, need:

1. the address of the host
2. an identifier that specifies the receiving process in the destination host

In the Internet, the host is identified by it
