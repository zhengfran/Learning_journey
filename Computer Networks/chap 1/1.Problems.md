###### P1. Design and describe an application-level protocol to be used between an automatic teller machine and a bank’s centralized computer. Your protocol should allow a user’s card and password to be verified, the account balance(which is maintained at the centralized computer) to be queried, and an account withdrawal to be made (that is, money disbursed to the user). Your protocol entities should be able to handle the all-too-common case in which there is not enough money in the account to cover the withdrawal. Specify your protocol by listing the messages exchanged and the action taken by the automatic teller machine or the bank’s centralized computer on transmission and receipt of messages. Sketch the operation of your protocol for the case of a simple withdrawal with no errors, using a diagram similar to that in Figure 1.2.Explicitly state the assumptions made by your protocol about the underlying end-to-end transport service.

###### P2. Equation 1.1 gives a formula for the end-to-end delay of sending one packet of length L over N links of transmission rate R. Generalize this formula for sending P such packets back-to-back over the N links.

${(L*N)}/R + ((P-1)*N)/R$

###### P3. Consider an application that transmits data at a steady rate (for example, the sender generates an N-bit unit of data every k time units, where k is small and fixed). Also, when such an application starts, it will continue running for a relatively long period of time. Answer the following questions, briefly justifying your answer:

1. Would a packet-switched network or a circuit-switched network be more appropriate for this application? Why?

   ~~Circuit-switched. Since the time not transmitting is little.~~

   > A  circuit-switched  network  would  be  well  suited  to  the  application,  because  the application  involves  long sessions  with  predictable  smooth  bandwidth  requirements. Since  the  transmission  rate  is  known  and  not  bursty,  bandwidth  can  be  reserved  for each  application  session  without significant  waste.  In  addition,  the  overhead  costs  of setting up and tearing down connections are amortized over the lengthy duration of a typical application session.

2. Suppose that a packet-switched network is used and the only traffic in this network comes from such applications as described above. Further-more, assume that the sum of the application data rates is less than the capacities of each and every link. Is some form of congestion control needed? Why?

   ~~No need. There will not be any congestion.~~

   > In  the  worst case,  all  the  applications  simultaneously  transmit  over  one  or  more network  links.  However,  since  each  link has sufficient  bandwidth  to  handle  the  sum of all  of  the  applications'  data  rates,  no  congestion  (very  little  queuing)  will  occur.Given  such  generous  link  capacities,  the  network  does  not  need  congestion  control mechanisms.

###### P4. Consider the circuit-switched network in Figure 1.13. Recall that there are 4 circuits on each link. Label the four switches A, B, C and D, going in the clockwise direction.

1. What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress at any one time in this network?

   16.

2. Suppose that all connections are between switches A and C. What is the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be in progress?

   8.

3. Suppose we want to make four connections between switches A and C,and another four connections between switches B and D. Can we route these calls through the four links to accommodate all eight connections?

   ~~Impossible.~~

   Yes. For the connections between A and C, we route two connections through B and two  connections  through  D.  For  the  connections  between  B  and  D,  we  route  two connections  through  A  and  two  connections  through  C.  In  this  manner,  there  are  at most 4 connections passing through any link. 

###### P5. Review the car-caravan analogy in Section 1.4. Assume a propagation speed of 100 km/hour

​	a. Suppose the caravan travels 150 km, beginning in front of one tollbooth,passing through a second tollbooth, and finishing just after a third toll-booth. What is the end-to-end delay?

​	There are ten cars. It takes 120 seconds, or 2 minutes, for the first tollbooth to service the  10  cars.  Each  of  these  cars  has  a  propagation  delay  of  45 minutes(travel  75  km)before  arriving  at  the  second  tollbooth.  Thus,  all  the  cars  are  lined  up  before  the second  tollbooth  after  47 minutes.  The  whole  process  repeats  itself  for  traveling between the second and third tollbooths. It also takes 2 minutes for the third tollbooth to service the 10 cars. Thus the total delay is 96 minutes.

​	b. Repeat (a), now assuming that there are eight cars in the caravan instead of ten.

​	$46.6*2+1.6 = 94.8 mins$

###### P6. This elementary problem begins to explore propagation delay and transmission delay, two central concepts in data networking. Consider two hosts, A and B, connected by a single link of rate *R* bps. Suppose that the two hosts are separated by *m* meters, and suppose the propagation speed along the link is *s* meters/sec. Host A is to send a packet of size *L* bits to Host B.

1. Express the propagation delay, $d_{prop}$ , in terms of m and s.

   $d_{prop} = m/s$

2. Determine the transmission time of the packet, $d_{trans}$, in terms of L and R.

   $d_{trans} = L/R$

3. Ignoring processing and queuing delays, obtain an expression for the end-to-end delay.

   $d_{end-to-end}=d_{prop}+d_{trans}$ 

4. Suppose Host A begins to transmit the packet at time t= 0. At time t=$t=d_{trans}$,where is the last bit of the packet?

   Just left Host A.

5. Suppose $d_{prop}$ is greater than $d_{trans}$. At time $t=d_{trans}$, where is the first bit of the packet?

   $d_{trans} * s$

6. Suppose $d_{prop}$ is less than $d_{trans}$. At time $t=d_{trans}$, where is the first bit of the packet?

   Host B

7. Suppose $s= 2.5 *10^8$,L= 120 bits, and R= 56 kbps. Find the distance m so that $d_{prop}$ equals $d_{trans}$.

   $120/{56000} * 2.5 *10^8 = 5.35*10^5 $

###### P7. In this problem, we consider sending real-time voice from Host A to Host B over a packet-switched network (VoIP). Host A converts analog voice to a digital 64 kbps bit stream on the fly. Host A then groups the bits into 56-byte packets. There is one link between Hosts A and B; its transmission rate is 2Mbps and its propagation delay is 10 msec. As soon as Host A gathers a packet, it sends it to Host B. As soon as Host B receives an entire packet, it converts the packet’s bits to an analog signal. How much time elapses from the time a bit is created (from the original analog signal at Host A) until the bit is decoded (as part of the analog signal at Host B)?

~~10.224 msec.~~

$10.224 + 56*8/64000 = 17.224 msec$

###### P8. Suppose users share a 3 Mbps link. Also suppose each user requires 150 kbps when transmitting, but each user transmits only 10 percent of the time. (See the discussion of packet switching versus circuit switching in Section 1.3.)

1. When circuit switching is used, how many users can be supported?

   20

2. For the remainder of this problem, suppose packet switching is used. Find the probability that a given user is transmitting.

   0.1.

3. Suppose there are 120 users. Find the probability that at any given time,exactly n users are transmitting simultaneously. (Hint: Use the binomial distribution.)

   $\binom{120}{n} 0.1^n0.9^{120-n}$

4. Find the probability that there are 21 or more users transmitting simultaneously

   $1-\sum_{n=0}^{20}\binom{120}{n} 0.1^{n} 0.9^{120-n}$ = 0.003

###### P9. Consider the discussion in Section 1.3 of packet switching versus circuit switching in which an example is provided with a 1 Mbps link. Users are generating data at a rate of 100 kbps when busy, but are busy generating data only with probability p= 0.1. Suppose that the 1 Mbps link is replaced by a 1 Gbps link.

1. What is N,the maximum number of users that can be supported simultaneously under circuit switching?

   10000.

2. Now consider packet switching and a user population of M users. Give a formula (in terms of p,M,N) for the probability that more than N users are sending data.

   $1-\sum_{n=0}^{N}\binom{M}{N} p^{N} (1-p)^{M-N}$

###### P10. Consider a packet of length L which begins at end system A and travels over three links to a destination end system. These three links are connected by two packet switches. Let $d_i$, $s_i$,and $R_i$denote the length, propagation speed,and the transmission rate of link i,for i= 1, 2, 3. The packet switch delays each packet by $d_{proc}$. Assuming no queuing delays, in terms of $d_i$, $s_i$, $R_i$,(i= 1,2,3), and L,what is the total end-to-end delay for the packet? Suppose now the packet is 1,500 bytes, the propagation speed on all three links is $2.5 ·10^8$ m/s, the transmission rates of all three links are 2 Mbps, the packet switch processing delay is 3 msec, the length of the first link is 5,000 km, the length of the second link is 4,000 km, and the length of the last link is 1,000 km. For these values, what is the end-to-end delay?

$2*d_{proc} + \sum_{i=1}^{3} (L/R_i + d_i/s_i)$

###### P11. In the above problem, suppose $R_1$=$R_2$=$R_3$=$R$ and $d_{proc}$= 0. Further suppose the packet switch does not store-and-forward packets but instead immediately transmits each bit it receives before waiting for the entire packet to arrive. What is the end-to-end delay?

$L/R + \sum_{i=1}^{3} ( d_i/s_i)$

###### P12. A packet switch receives a packet and determines the outbound link to which the packet should be forwarded. When the packet arrives, one other packet is halfway done being transmitted on this outbound link and four other packets are waiting to be transmitted. Packets are transmitted in order of arrival.Suppose all packets are 1,500 bytes and the link rate is 2 Mbps. What is the queuing delay for the packet? More generally, what is the queuing delay when all packets have length L, the transmission rate is R,x bits of the currently-being-transmitted packet have been transmitted, and n packets are already in the queue?

$L*n/R+(L-x)/R$

###### P13. (a) Suppose N packets arrive simultaneously to a link at which no packets are currently being transmitted or queued. Each packet is of length L and the link has transmission rate R. What is the average queuing delay for the N packets?

$(\sum_{N=0}^{N} ( N*L/R))/N$

###### (b) Now suppose that N such packets arrive to the link every LN/R seconds.What is the average queuing delay of a packet?

~~0.~~

The average delay of a packet across all batches is the **average delay within one batch**.

###### P14. Consider the queuing delay in a router buffer. Let I denote traffic intensity;that is, $I=La/R$. Suppose that the queuing delay takes the form $IL/R(1 – I)$ for $I< 1$. 

1. Provide a formula for the total delay, that is, the queuing delay plus the transmission delay.

   $ IL/R(1 – I) + L/R $

2. Plot the total delay as a function of L/R

   Total delay = $\frac {L/R}{1-a*L/R}$

###### P15. Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at a link in packets/sec, and let μ denote the link’s transmission rate in packets/sec. Based on the formula for the total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) derived in the previous problem, derive a formula for the total delay in terms of a and μ.

$1/u = L/R; a = a$ thus

$\frac {1/u}{1-a/u} = \frac{1}{u-a}$

###### P16. Consider a router buffer preceding an outbound link. In this problem, you will use Little’s formula, a famous formula from queuing theory. Let N denote the average number of packets in the buffer plus the packet being transmitted. Let a denote the rate of packets arriving at the link. Let d denote the average total delay (i.e., the queuing delay plus the transmission delay) experienced by a packet. Little’s formula is N=a·d. Suppose that on average, the buffer contains 10 packets, and the average packet queuing delay is 10 msec. The link’s transmission rate is 100 packets/sec. Using Little’s formula, what is the average packet arrival rate, assuming there is no packet loss? 

~~500~~

N = 10 +1 **Include the one that is being transmitted**

thus $ a = \frac {11}{0.01+0.01}= 550$

###### P17. a. Generalize Equation 1.2 in Section 1.4.3 for heterogeneous processing rates, transmission rates, and propagation delays.



###### b.  Repeat (a), but now also suppose that there is an average queuing delay of $d_{queue}$ at each node.

> feel like a pointless question

###### P18. Perform a Traceroute between source and destination on the same continent at three different hours of the day.

###### a.  Find the average and standard deviation of the round-trip delays at each of the three hours.

On linux you can use the command`traceroute www.targethost.comand `

in the Windows command prompt you can use `tracert www.targethost.com`

###### b.  Find the number of routers in the path at each of the three hours. Did the paths change during any of the hours?

###### c.   Try to identify the number of ISP networks that the Traceroute packets pass through from source to destination. Routers with similar names and/or similar IP addresses should be considered as part of the same ISP. In your experiments,do the largest delays occur at the peering interfaces between adjacent ISPs?

Largest delay occurred at peering interfaces between adjacent ISPs.

###### d.  Repeat the above for a source and destination on different continents.Compare the intra-continent and inter-continent results.

###### P19. (a) Visit the site www.traceroute.org and perform  traceroutes from two different cities in France to the same destination host in the United States. How many links are the same in the two traceroutes? Is the transatlantic link the same? 

###### (b) Repeat (a) but this time choose one city in France and another city inGermany.

###### (c) Pick a city in the United States, and perform traceroutes to two hosts, eachin a different city in China. How many links are common in the twotraceroutes? Do the two traceroutes diverge before reaching China?

###### P20.  Consider the throughput example corresponding to Figure 1.20(b). Now suppose that there are M client-server pairs rather than 10. Denote Rs,Rc, and R for the rates of the server links, client links, and network link. Assume all other links have abundant capacity and that there is no other traffic in the network besides the traffic generated by the M client-server pairs. Derive a general expression for throughput in terms of Rs,Rc,R, and M.

~~min(R_s,R_c,R)​~~

$min(R_s,R_c,R/M)$

###### P21. Consider Figure 1.19(b). Now suppose that there are M paths between the server and the client. No two paths share any link. Path k(k= 1, . . ., M) consists of N links with transmission rates Rk1,Rk2, . . ., RkN. If the server can only use one path to send data to the client, what is the maximum throughput that the server can achieve? If the server can use all M paths to send data, what is the maximum throughput that the server can achieve?

$max(min(R_1^1,R_2^1,R_3^1,...,R_N^1),min(R_1^2,R_2^2,R_3^2,...,R_N^1)...min(R_1^M,R_2^M,R_3^M,...,R_N^M))$

###### P22. Consider Figure 1.19(b). Suppose that each link between the server and the client has a packet loss probability p,and the packet loss probabilities for these links are independent. What is the probability that a packet (sent by the server) is successfully received by the receiver? If a packet is lost in the path from the server to the client, then the server will re-transmit the packet. On average, how many times will the server re-transmit the packet in order for the client to successfully receive the packet?

~~1-p~~ should be $P_s=(1-p)^N$

~~1/(1-p)~~ should be $\frac {1}{P_s}-1$ Note: -1 due to it asks for number of retransmissions

###### P23. Consider Figure 1.19(a). Assume that we know the bottleneck link along the path from the server to the client is the first link with rate Rs bits/sec. Suppose we send a pair of packets back to back from the server to the client, and there is no other traffic on this path. Assume each packet of size L bits, and both links have the same propagation delay $d_{prop}$.

###### a.  What is the packet inter-arrival time at the destination? That is, how much time elapses from when the last bit of the first packet arrives until the last bit of the second packet arrives?

$\frac{L}{R_s}$

###### b.   Now assume that the second link is the bottleneck link (i.e., Rc<Rs). Is it possible that the second packet queues at the input queue of the second link? Explain. Now suppose that the server sends the second packet T seconds after sending the first packet. How large must T be to ensure no queuing before the second link? Explain.

~~$d_{prop}+\frac{L}{R_c}$~~ wrong!

T should satisfy the inequality $\frac{L}{R_s} + \frac{L}{R_s} + d_{prop} + T >= \frac{L}{R_s} + \frac{L}{R_c} + d_{prop}$

Thus $T >= \frac{L}{R_c} - \frac{L}{R_s}$

###### P24. Suppose you would like to urgently deliver 40 terabytes data from Boston to Los Angeles. You have available a 100 Mbps dedicated link for data transfer.Would you prefer to transmit the data via this link or instead use FedEx over-night delivery? Explain.

~~Via this link, although much longer time but your data will not be sent to anywhere else.~~

40 terabytes = 40 * 1012* 8 bits.So, if using the dedicated link, it will take 40 * 1012* 8 / (100  *10^6)  =3200000 seconds  =  37  days. But  with  FedEx  overnight  delivery,  you  can guarantee the data arrives in one day, and it should cost less than $100.

###### P25. Suppose two hosts, A and B, are separated by 20,000 kilometers and are connected by a direct link of R= 2 Mbps. Suppose the propagation speed over the link is 2.5 *10^8 meters/sec.

###### a.  Calculate the bandwidth-delay product, R*dprop.

$2*10^6 * \frac{2*10^7}{2.5*10^8}=1.6*10^5$

###### b.  Consider sending a file of 800,000 bits from Host A to Host B. Suppose the file is sent continuously as one large message. What is the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?

$1.6*10^5$

###### c.  Provide an interpretation of the bandwidth-delay product.

The bandwidth-delay product of a link is the maximum number of bits that can be in the link.

###### d.  What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link? Is it longer than a foot-ball field?

125m

###### e.  Derive a general expression for the width of a bit in terms of the propagation speed s,the transmission rate R,and the length of the link m.

$s/R$

###### P26. Referring to problem P25, suppose we can modify R. For what value of R is the width of a bit as long as the length of the link?

$s/R = L$ -> $R = s/L$

###### P27. Consider problem P25 but now with a link of R= 1 Gbps.

###### a.  Calculate the bandwidth-delay product, R*dprop.

$8*10^7$

###### b.  Consider sending a file of 800,000 bits from Host A to Host B. Suppose the file is sent continuously as one big message. What is the maximum number of bits that will be in the link at any given time?

$800,000$

###### c.  What is the width (in meters) of a bit in the link?

25m

###### P28.  Refer again to problem P25

###### a.  How long does it take to send the file, assuming it is sent continuously?

80+400=480 msec

###### b.  Suppose now the file is broken up into 20 packets with each packet containing 40,000 bits. Suppose that each packet is acknowledged by the receiver and the transmission time of an acknowledgment packet is negligible. Finally, assume that the sender cannot send a packet until the preceding one is acknowledged. How long does it take to send the file?

(80 + 20) * 20 =2000 msec = 2s

###### c.  Compare the results from (a) and (b)

Breaking  up  a  file takes  longer  to  transmit  because  each  data  packet  and  its corresponding acknowledgement packet add their own propagation delays

###### P29. Suppose there is a 10 Mbps microwave link between a geostationary satellite and its base station on Earth. Every minute the satellite takes a digital photo and sends it to the base station. Assume a propagation speed of 2.4 *10^8 meters/sec.

###### a.  What is the propagation delay of the link?

36,000,000/240,000,000 = 0.15s

###### b.  What is the bandwidth-delay product, R*dprop?

10,000,000*0.15=1,500,000 bits

###### c.  Let x denote the size of the photo. What is the minimum value of x for the microwave link to be continuously transmitting?

10,000,000*60=600,000,000 bits

###### P30. Consider the airline travel analogy in our discussion of layering in Section 1.5, and the addition of headers to protocol data units as they flow down the protocol stack. Is there an equivalent notion of header information that is added to passengers and baggage as they move down the airline protocol stack?

Let’s suppose the passenger and his/her bags correspond to the data unit arriving to the top of the protocol stack.  When the passenger checks in, his/her bags are checked, and a tag  is  attached  to  the  bags  and  ticket.    This  is  additional  information  added in  the Baggage  layer  if  Figure  1.20  that  allows  the  Baggage  layer  to  implement  the  service  or separating  the  passengers  and  baggage  on  the  sending  side,  and  then  reuniting  them (hopefully!) on the destination side.  When a passenger then passes through security and additional stamp is often added to his/her ticket, indicating that the passenger has passed through a security check.  This information is used to ensure (e.g., by later checks for the security information) secure transfer of people

###### P31.  In modern packet-switched networks, including the Internet, the source host segments long, application-layer messages (for example, an image or a music file) into smaller packets and sends the packets into the network. The receiver then reassembles the packets back into the original message. We refer to this process as message segmentation. Figure 1.27 illustrates the end-to-end transport of a message with and without message segmentation. Consider a message that is 8 · 10^6 bits long that is to be sent from source to destination in Figure 1.27. Suppose each link in the figure is 2 Mbps. Ignore propagation,queuing, and processing delays.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\P32_1.27.PNG)

###### a.  Consider sending the message from source to destination without message segmentation. How long does it take to move the message from the source host to the first packet switch? Keeping in mind that each switch uses store-and-forward packet switching, what is the total time to move the message from source host to destination host?

4s;12s.

###### b.  Now suppose that the message is segmented into 800 packets, with each packet being 10,000 bits long. How long does it take to move the first packet from source host to the first switch? When the first packet is being sent from the first switch to the second switch, the second packet is being sent from the source host to the first switch. At what time will the second packet be fully received at the first switch?

5msec;10msec.

###### c.  How long does it take to move the file from source host to destination host when message segmentation is used? Compare this result with your answer in part (a) and comment.

~~15+(800-3)*5 =4sec.~~

15+799*5= 4.01s Every 5 msec one packet will be received at destination.

Significantly less delay.

###### d.  In addition to reducing delay, what are reasons to use message segmentation?

- Without message  segmentation, if  bit  errors  are  not  tolerated,  if  there  is  a single bit error, the whole message has to be retransmitted (rather than a single packet)

- Without  message  segmentation,  huge  packets  (containing  HD  videos,  for example) are sent into the network. Routers have to accommodate these huge packets.  Smaller  packets  have  to  queue  behind  enormous  packets  and  suffer unfair delays.

###### e.  Discuss the drawbacks of message segmentation.

- Packets have to be put in sequence at the destination.

- Message  segmentation  results  in  many  smaller  packets.  Since  header  size  is usually  the  same  for all packets  regardless  of their size,  with  message segmentation the total amount of header bytes is more.

###### P32.  Experiment with the Message Segmentation applet at the book’s Web site. Do the delays in the applet correspond to the delays in the previous problem?How do link propagation delays affect the overall end-to-end delay for packet switching (with message segmentation) and for message switching?

Yes, the delays in the applet correspond to the delays in the Problem 31.The propagation delays  affect  the  overall  end-to-end  delays  both  for  packet  switching  and  message switching equally.

P33.   Consider sending a large file of F bits from Host A to Host B. There are three links (and two switches) between A and B, and the links are uncongested (that is, no queuing delays). Host A segments the file into segments of S bits each and adds 80 bits of header to each segment, forming packets of L= 80 + S bits. Each link has a transmission rate of R bps. Find the value of S that minimizes the delay of moving the file from Host A to Host B. Disregard propagation delay

$\frac {(80+S)*3}{R} +(F/S-1)*(80+S)/R $

Use differnciating, $S = \sqrt{40F}$ 

###### P34.   Skype offers a service that allows you to make a phone call from a PC to an ordinary phone. This means that the voice call must pass through both the Internet and through a telephone network. Discuss how this might be done.

The  circuit-switched  telephone  networks  and  the  Internet  are  connected  together  at "gateways". When a Skype user (connected to the Internet) calls an ordinary telephone, a circuit is established between a gateway and the telephone user over the circuit switched network. The skype user's voice is sent in packets over the Internet to the gateway. At the gateway,  the  voice  signal  is  reconstructed  and  then  sent  over  the  circuit.  In  the  other direction,  the  voice  signal  is  sent  over  the  circuit  switched  network to  the  gateway.  The gateway packetizes the voice signal and sends the voice packets to the Skype user.
