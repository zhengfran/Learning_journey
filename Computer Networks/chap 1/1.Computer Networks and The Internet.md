### 1. Computer Networks and The Internet

This chapter is all about big pictures,

#### 1.1 What is Internet?

##### 1.1.1 A Nuts-and-Bolts Description

End systems are connected together by a network of **communication links** and **packet switches**.

 Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the transmission rate of a link measured in bits/second. When data is being sent, data is segmented, and each segment has a added header. One segment with header is known as **packets**, which are reassembled into original data after reaching the destination.

A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. Two most prominent types of packet switching: **routers** and **link-layer switches**. Both forward their packets towards their ultimate destinations.

Link-layer switches are typically used in access networks, while routers are typically used in network core. The sequence of communication links traversed by a packet from sending end to receiving end is known as a **route**.

End systems access the Internet through **Internet Service Providers(ISPs)**, including residential ISPs;corporate ISPs;university ISPs,etc. Each ISP is in itself a network of packet switches and communication links. ISPs provide a variety of types of network access to end systems, including residential broadband access such as cable modem or DSL ,etc. ISPs also provide Internet access to content providers, connecting Web sites directly to the Internet. The Internet is all about connecting end systems to each other, so the ISPs that provide access to end systems must also be interconnected. Low-tier ISPs are interconnected through upper-tier ISPs such as Level 3 Communications.,AT&T,etc. each ISP network, is managed independently , runs the **IP protocol** , and conforms to certain naming and address conventions.

End systems,packet switches, and other pieces of Internet run **protocols** that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.**Transmission Control Protocol** and **Internet Protocol** are two of the most important protocols in the Internet. IP Protocol specifies the format of the packets that are sent and received among routers and end systems. **TCP/IP** known as the principal protocols in Internet. 

##### 1.1.2 A services Description

AN entirely different angle, Internet is *an infrastructure that provides services to applications*. The applications are **distributed applications** since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. Importantly, Internet applications run on end systems, **not** in the packet switches in the network core. Packet switches facilitate the exchange of data among end systems, but they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.

End systems attached to the Internet provide an **Application Programming Interface(API)** that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system. The **Internet API** is a set of rules that the sending program must follow so that the Internet can deliver the data to the destination program. 

##### 1.1.3 What is a Protocol?

###### A Human Analogy

In human protocol, there are specific messages we send, and specific actions we take in response to the received reply messages or other events.

###### Network Protocols

All activities in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.

> A **protocol** defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken on the trans-mission and/or receipt of a message or other event



#### 1.2 The Network Edge

Desktop computers,servers, and mobile computers are referred as end systems because they sit at the edge of the Internet, and there is an increasing number of non-traditional devices (IOT?). 

End systems are also referred to as hosts because they host application programs such as Web browser program, a Web server program, an email client program, or an email server program. Hosts are divided into two categories:**clients** and **servers**. E.g. Google has 30-50 data centers, with many having more than 100,000 servers.

##### 1.2.1 Access Networks

###### Home Access: DSL,Cable,FTTH,Dial-up, and Satellite

Two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are **digital subscriber line(DSL)** and cable.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\hybrid fiber-coaxial.PNG)

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\FTTH.PNG)

###### Access in the Enterprise (and the Home): Ethernet and Wifi

A local network (**LAN**) is used to connect an end system to the edge router. **Ethernet** is by far the most prevalent access technology in corporate, university and home networks.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\Ethernet.PNG)

The Ethernet switch, or a network of such interconnected switches, is then connected into the larger Internet.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\typical home.PNG)

###### Wide_Area Wireless Access: 3G(5G comming soon?) and LTE

Within *a few tens of kilometers* (as opposed to *a few tens of meters*) of the base station.

##### 1.2.2 Physical Media

**HFC** -> combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable

**DSL**&**Ethernet** -> copper wire

**Mobile access networks** -> radio spectrum

Two categories: 

- **guided media**  -> solid medium

-  **unguided media** -> in atmosphere or outer space, wireless LAN or digital satellite channel

Costs of physical link is relatively minor.

###### Twisted_pair Copper Wire

###### Coaxial Cable

###### Fiber Optics

###### Terrestrial Radio Channels

###### Satellite Radio Channels



#### 1.3 The Network Core

The mesh of packet switches and links that interconnects the Internet's hosts.

##### 1.3.1 Packet Switching

In a network application, hosts exchange messages with each other. Messages may perform a control function or can contain data, such as an email message, a JPEG image, or an MP3 audio file. The source end systems break long messages into smaller chunks of data known as packets. They travel through communication links and packet switches, at a rate equal of the full transmission rate of the link.

###### Store-and-Forward Transmission

Packet switches must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\Store-and-forward.PNG)

End to end delay = $d_{end-to-end} = N * L / R$

###### Queuing Delays and Packet Loss

Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an output buffer. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer, suffering **queuing delays** . If the buffer is completely full, **packet loss** will occur.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\packet switching.PNG)

###### Forwarding Tables and Routing Protocols

Q: How does the router determine which link it should forward the packet to?

Every end system has an **IP address**. The source will include the destination's IP address in the packet's header. Since the address has a hierarchical structure, when a packet arrives at a router in the network, the router examines a portion of the packet's destination address and forwards the packet to an adjacent router. More specifically, each router has a **forwarding table** that maps destination address to that router's outbound link.

Q: How do forwarding tables get set?

Internet has a number of special routing protocols which are used to set forwarding table automatically. A routing protocol may , determine the shortest path from each router to each destination and use the shortest path results to configure the forwarding tables in the routers.

##### 1.3.2 Circuit Switching

In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path(buffer,link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are ***reserved*** for the duration of the communication session between the end systems. e.g. traditional telephone networks.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\circuit switching.PNG)

###### Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks

A circuit in a link is implemented with either **frequency-division multiplexing(FDM)** or **time-division multiplexing(TDM)** . 

With FDM, the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link

For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of slots. When the network establishes a connection across the link, the network dedicates one time slot in every frame to this connection.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\FDMvsTDM.PNG)

###### Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching

**Packet Switching:** 

- Cons:
  - Not suitable for real-time services because of its variable and unpredictable end-to-end delays.  
- Pros:
  - Offers better sharing of transmission capacity 
  - Simpler,more efficient and less costly to implement than circuit switching

**Circuit Switching:**

- Cons: Pre-allocate uses of transmission rate among multiple data streams regardless of demand

The trend has certainly been in the direction of **packet switching.**

##### A Networks of Networks

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\Interconnection of ISPs.PNG)

In summary, today’s Internet—a network of networks—is complex, consisting of a dozen or so tier-1 ISPs and hundreds of thousands of lower-tier ISPs. The ISPs are diverse in their coverage, with some spanning multiple continents and oceans, and others  limited  to  narrow  geographic  regions.  The  lower-tier  ISPs  connect  to  the higher-tier ISPs, and the higher-tier ISPs interconnect with one another. Users and content providers are customers of lower-tier ISPs, and lower-tier ISPs are customers of higher-tier ISPs.



#### 1.4 Delay,Loss and Throughput in Packet-Switched Networks

##### 1.4.1 Overview of Delay in Packet-Switched Networks

Recall that a packet starts in a host,passes through a series of routers, and ends its journey in another host. Along the path, the packet suffers from several types of delays at each node along the path:

- nodal processing delay
- queuing delay
- transmission delay
- propagation delay

They accumulate to give a **total nodal delay**.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\nodal delay at a route.PNG)

###### Processing Delay

Time required to examine the packet's header and determine where to direct the packet is part of the processing delay. Including the time needed to check for bit-level errors in the packet. It takes order of **microseconds** or less.

###### Queuing Delay

Length of queuing delay depends on the number of earlier-arriving packets that are queued and waiting for transmission onto the link. Order of **microseconds** to **milliseconds** in practice.

###### Transmission Delay

The amount of time required to fully push all of the packet's bits into the link.

###### Propagation Delay

Time required to propagate from the beginning of the link to router B is the propagation delay. Depends on the physical medium, the propagation speed is in range of $2*10^8$ meters/sec to $3*10^8$ meters/sec

###### Transmission Delay VS Propagation Delay

The transmission delay is the amount of time required for the router to push out the packet; it is a function of the **packet’s length** and the **transmission rate of the link**.

The propagation delay, on the other hand, is the time it takes a bit to propagate from one router to the next; it is a function of the **distance between the two routers**.

##### 1.4.2 Queuing Delay and Packet Loss

Queuing delay is typically measured in statistical measures, such as average queuing delay, variance of queuing delay, and the probability that the queuing delay exceeds some specified value.

Assume units arrive in $a$ packets/sec, $R$ is the transmission rate, packets are all L bits. The ratio $La/R$ is called **traffic intensity**.

If $La/R > 1$, then the average rate at which bits arrive at the queue exceeds the rate at which bits can be transmitted from the queue. Hence, golden rules in traffic engineering is :

> Design your system so that the traffic intensity is no greater than 1.

If $La/R <=1$, nature of arriving traffic impacts the queuing delay. If the packets arrive **periodically**, there will be no queuing delay. If the packets arrive in bursts but periodically, there can be a significant average queuing delay.

Typically, the arrival process to a queue is *random*.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\queuing delay vs traffic intensity.PNG)

###### Packet Loss

In reality a queue preceding a link has finite capacity,although  the  queuing  capacity  greatly  depends  on  the  router  design  and  cost.Because the queue capacity is finite, packet delays do not really approach infinity as the traffic intensity approaches 1. Instead, a packet can arrive to find a full queue.With no place to store such a packet, a router will **drop** that packet; that is, the packet will be **lost**. 

Therefore, performance at a node is often measured not only in terms of delay, but also in terms of the **probability of packet loss**.

##### 1.4.3 End-to-End Delay

Total delay from source to destination.

Suppose there are N-1 routers in between, and the network is uncongested .

> $d_{end-to-end} = N(d_{proc}+d_{trans}+d_{prop})$

###### End System, Apllication, and Other Delays

Some other delays:

- An end system wanting to transmit a packet into a shared medium may *purposefully* delay its transmission as part of its protocol for sharing the medium with other end systems.

- Media packetization delay, which is present in VoIP applications. In VoIP, the sending side must first fill a packet with encoded digitized speech before passing the packet to the Internet.

##### 1.4.4 Throughput in Computer Networks

Consider transferring a large file from Host A to Host B.

The **instantaneous throughput** at any instant of time is the rate at which Host B is receiving the file. If the file consists of F bits and the transfer takes T seconds for Host B to receive all bits, then **average throughput** of the file transfer is $F/T$ bits/sec. For some applications, including those involving file transfers, delay is not critical, but desirable to have the highest possible throughput.

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\Throughput for a file transfer from server to client.PNG)

For a. the throughput is min{$R_c,R_s$}, the transmission rate of the **bottleneck link**.

For b, the throughput is min{$R_1,R_2,R_3,R_4...R_N$}

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\end to end throughput(Internet).PNG)

For a: throughput is again min{$R_c,R_s$}, the constraining factor for throughput in today's Internet is typically the access network.

For b: If rate of the common link R is much larger than -- say a hundred times larger than both $R_s$ and $R_c$ , then throughput would still be min{$R_c,R_s$}.

However, suppose $R_s = 2 Mbps,R_c = 1Mbps,R=5Mbps$, and the common link divides its transmission rate equally among the 10 downloads. The bottleneck is no longer in the access network, but the shared link in the core, which only provides 500 kbps of throughput.

In summary, when there is no other intervening traffic, the throughput can simply be approximated as the minimum transmission rate along the path between source and destination. more generally the throughput depends not only on the transmission rates of the links along the path, but also on the intervening traffic.

#### 1.5 Protocol Layer and Their Service Modesl

##### 1.5.1 Layered Architecture

Each layer provides its service by :

1. performing certain actions within that layer
2. using the services of the layer directly below it

Layering has an important advantage, the ability to change the implementation of a service without affecting other components of the system. 

###### Protocol Layering

A protocol layer can be implemented in software, in hardware, or in a combination of two. 

- Application Layer protocols such as HTTP and SMTP are almost always implemented in software in the end systems; so are transport-layer protocols
- Physical and data link layers are responsible for handling communication over a specific link, they are typically implemented in a network interface card(i.e. Ethernet or WiFi interface cards) associated with a given link.
- Network layer is often a mixed implementation of hardware and software.

A layer n protocol distributed among the end systems, packet switches, and other components that make up the network

Advantages:

- Easier to upgrade system components
- Provides a structured way to discuss system components

Drawbacks:

- One layer may duplicate lower-layer functionality. e.g. many protocol stacks provide error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis.
- Functionality at one layer may need information that is present only in another layer; which violates the goal of separation of layers

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\Internet Protocol Stack ans OSI model.PNG)

###### Application Layer

This is where network applications and their application-layer protocols reside.

An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. We’ll refer to this packet of information at the application layer as a **message**.

###### Transport Layer

Transports  application-layer  messages  between application endpoints.

There are two transport protocols, TCP and UDP, either of which can transport application-layer messages. 

TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its applications:

- guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination
- flow control(sender/receiver speed matching)
- breaks long messages into shorter segments and provide a congestion-control mechansim, so the source throttle its transmission rate when the network is congested

UDP provides a connectionless service to its applications:

- no reliability, no flow control, no congestion control

A transport-layer packet is a segment.

###### Network Layer

Responsible for moving network-layer packets known as **datagrams** from one host to another.

It includes the celebrated IP Protocol, which defines the fields in the datagram as well as how the end systems and routers act on these fields. There is **only one IP protocol** and all Internet components that has a network layer must run the IP protocol.

It also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations, there are many routing protocols in the Internet.

###### Link Layer

The Internet's network layer routes a datagram through a series of routers between the source and destination. To move a packet from one node to next node in the route, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. 

The network layer passes the datagram down to the link layer, which delivers the datagram to the next node along the route. At this next node, the link layer passes the datagram up to the network layer.

Link_layer packets are referred as **frames**.

###### Physical Layer

While the job of the link layer is to move entire frames from one network element to an adjacent network element, the job of the physical layer is to move the *individual bits* within the frame from one node to the next.

The protocols in this layer are again **link dependent** and further depend on the actual transmission **medium** of the link. e.g. Ethernet  has  many  physical-layer  protocols:  one  for  twisted-pair copper wire,another for coaxial cable, another for fiber, and so on.

###### The OSI Model

Presentation layer: provide services that allow  communicating  applications  to  interpret  the  meaning of data exchanged. Its services include data compression, data encryption and data description. 

Session layer: provides for delimiting and synchronization of data exchange, including the means to build a check pointing and recovery scheme.

##### 1.5.2 Encapsulation

![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\encapsulation.PNG)

Hosts implement all 5 layers which is consistent with the view that the Internet architecture puts much of its complexity at the edges of the network.

Note how each layer adds corresponding header to the message, and different names:

- application-layer message

- Transport-layer segment
- Network-layer datagram
- Link-layer frame

At each layer, a packet has two types of fields: header fields and a **payload** field. The payload is typically a packet from the layer above.

#### 1.6. Networks Under Attack

What can go wrong?

How are computer networks vulnerable?

What are some of the more prevalent types of attacks today?

###### The bad guys can put malware into your host via the Internet

Malware enter device -> formed a botnet together with other infected devices -> Dos attack

**Self-replicating**->spread in form of **virus** or a **worm** 

Virus: require some form of user interation

worm: enter a device without any explicit user interaction

What can computer network designers do to defend Internet-attached devices from malware attacks?

###### The bad guys can attack servers and network infrastructure

**Denial-of-service(DoS) attacks**

- *Vulnerability attack*

  Send a well-crafted message to a vulnerable application or operating system running on a targeted host, causing the service to stop, or worse, the host can crash.

- *Bandwidth flooding*

  Send a deluge of packets to the targeted host, clogging the target's access link, and prevent legitimate packets from reaching the server

  DDoS:

  ![](C:\Users\zhengzc8270\Documents\github_repos\computer networks\chap 1\1.images\DDoS.PNG)

- *Connection flooding*

  Establish a large number of half-open or fully-open TCP connections at the target host, causing it stops accepting legitimate connections

###### The bad guys can sniff packets

**Packet sniffer:** Wireless networks-> use passive receiver in the vicinity of the wireless transmitter -> obtains a copy of every single packet send

e,g, Wireshark

Defenses against: cryptography

###### The bad guys can masquerade as someone you trust

**IP spoofing:** inject packets into the Internet with a false source address

Counter-measure: *end-point authentication*-> a mechanism that will allow us to determine with certainty if a message originates from where we think it does
