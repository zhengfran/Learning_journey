Uniqueness of GO:

- **Clean and Simple**: do a lot within a few lines of code
- **Concurrent** : "fire off" functions to be run as very lightweight threads called goroutines
- **Channels**: Communication between goroutines via channels

- **Fast**: Fast Compilation and execution

- **Safe**: Explicit casting and strict rules when converting one type to another; has garbage collection

- **Standard format**: *gofmt* is the *official endorsed format*

- **Postfix** **types**: Types are given after the variable name

- **UTF-8**: everywhere, in strings and in the programe code

  **Open Source**!!!  					&&  				**Fun!!!**



##### Hello,world:

```go
package main //@1
//Implement formatted I/O
import "fmt" //@2
//print something
func main(){ //@3
    fmt.Printf("Hello,world; or 你好，世界") //@4
}
```

1. Just required, all go files start with package <something>, for standalone executable, main is required
2. Need *fmt* in addition to *main*. A package other than *main* is called a *library*
3. First Package, then imports, then everything else. First function called always *main.main()*
4. Call a function from *fmt* to print a string to the screen

###### Compiling and running code

```go
% go build helloworld.go
%./helloworld
```

###### Variables, types and keywords

Type of a variable specified *after* the variable name and initialized with null when declaring a variable

```go
var a int
var b bool
a = 15
b = false
```

=

```go
a := 15
b := false
// := is a delaration
// = is an assignment
```

Multiple variables of the **same type** can be declared in one line;

_(underscore) is a special variable name, any value assigned to it will be discarded.

```go
a, b := 20, 16
```

Declared but otherwise unused variables are a compiler error in Go,e.g:

```go
package main
func main(){
    var i int
}
```

- Boolean

  True or False

- Numerical types

  *int* : 32 bits on a 32-bit machine and 64-bits on a 64-bit machine, same for *uint* 

  Explicit about length : *"int8, int16, int32, int64"*  *"byte(uint8),uint16,uint32,uint64"* *"float32,float64"*

  ```go
  package main
  func main(){
      var a int
      var b int32
      a = 15
      b = a + a //<- illegal mix of types
      b = b + 5 //5 is constant.OK
  }
  ```

- Constants

  Created as compile time, can only be numbers, strings or booleans.

  *iota* can be used to enumerate values

  ```go
  const (
      a = iota
      b = iota
  )
  
  //or let go repeat use of = iota
  const (
      a = iota
      b
  )
  
  //or explicitly type a constant
  const (
      a = 0
      b string = "0"
  )
  ```

- Strings

  Strings in Go are sequence of UTF-8 characters enclosed in **double quotes**

  **Single quote** mean one character(still in UTF-8), but not a string.

  Strings in Go are **immutable**.

  ```go
  var s string = "hello"
  s[0] = 'c' //<- this is an error to change first character to 'c'
  
  //Correct way to do it in go
  s:= "hello"
  c:= []rune(s) 	//@1
  c[0] = 'c'	//@2
  s2 := string(c)	//@3
  fmt.Printf("%s\n",s2)	//@4
  ```

  1. Convert *s* to an array of runes
  2. change the first element of this array
  3. Create a new string *s2* with the alteration
  4. print the string

- Multi-line strings

  ```go
  s := "Starting part"
  	+ "Ending part"
  //above is transformed into
  s := "Starting part";
  	+ "Ending part";
  //which is not valid synyax,should write like
  s := "Staring part" +
  	 "Ending part"
  //The Go will not insert semicolons in wrong places
  //or use raw string literals by using backquotes(`):
  s ;= `Starting part 
  	Ending part`
  //The s in this example also contains newline.
  // This raw string literal is composed of the /*uninterpreted*/ charaters between the // quotes
  ```

- Runes

  Runes is an alias of int 32.

  Use in  e.g. iterating over characters in a string

- Complex numbers

  *complex128*(64 bit real and imaginary parts)

  complex64(32 bit real and imaginary parts)

  Complex numbers are written as $re +im i$

  ```go
  var c complex64 = 5+5i;fmt.Printf("Value is: %v",c)
  ```

- Errors

  "var e error" creates a variable e of type error with the value nil.

  This error type is an interface.

###### Control structures

- *If-else*

  ```go
  if x > 0{
      return y
  }	else {
      return x
  }
  //Mandatory braces
  
  //if and switch accept an initialization statement e.g.
  if err := Chmod(0664); err !=nil{ //nil is like C's NULL
      fmt.Printf(err)		//<-scope of err is limited to if's body
      return err
  }
  //logical operators can also be used
  if ture && true{
      fmt.Println("true")
  }
  if !false {
      fmt.Println("true")
  }
  //When the if's body end in /*breal,continue,goto,return*/,
  //the uncessary else is omitted
  f, err := os.Open(name, os._RDONLY, 0)
  if err != nil{
      return err
  }
  doSomething(f)
  //sytax wise { must be on the same line as the if
  //so below is illegal
  if err != nil
  {
      return err
  }
  
  ```

- Goto

  With *goto* you jump to a label which must be defined within the current function.

  ```go
  func myfunc(){
      i:=0
  Here:	//First word on a line ending with a colon is a /*label*/
      println(i)
      i++
      goto Here //Name of the label is case sensitive
  }
  ```

- For

  three forms

  ```go
  for init;condition;post{}	//Like a C for
  for condition{}	//Like a while
  for {}	//Endless loop
  
  sum := 0
  for i := 0;i < 10; i++{
      sum += i
  }	//i ceasse to exist after the loop
  
  //Multiple variables in a for
  //e.g. reverse a
  for i, j := 0, len(a)-1; i < j; i ,j = i+1, j-1{
      a[i], a[j]= a[j], a[i] //parallel assignment
  }
  ```

- Break and continue

  With *break* you can quit loops early.

  ```go
  for i:=0; i<10; i++ {
      if i>5{
          break	//<- stop this loop, making it only print 0 to 5
      }
      println(i)
  }
  ```

  Specify a label after break.

  ```go
  J: for j:=0; j<5; j++{
      for i:=0;i<10;i++{
          if i>5{
              break J
          }
          printfln(i)
      }
  }
  ```

  *continue* begin the next iteration of the loop,skipping ant remaining code. Also accepts *label*

  ```go
  for i:=5;i<10;i++{
      if i>5{
          continue //<= skip the rest of the remaining code in the lopp
      }
      println(i)
  }
  ```

- Range

  Can be used for loops, can loop over *slices, arrays, strings, maps,channels*.

  When called, return the next key-value pair from the thing it loops over

  When looping over a slice or array, it returns the index in the slice as the key and value belonging tp that index.

  ```go
  list :=[]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"} //@1
  for k,v := range list{	//@2
      //do something with k and v		//@3
  }
  ```

  1. Create a slice of strings
  2. Use *range* to loop over them
  3. k will have value 0...5, and v will loop through "a"..."f".

  Use range on strings directly.

  ```go
  for pos, char := range"apx"{
      fmt.Printf("character '%c' starts at byte position %d\n",char,pos)
  }
  ```

- Switch

  The expression need not be constants or even integers; 

  the cases are evaluated top from bottom until a match is found;

  no expression it switches on true.

  ```go
  func unhex(c byte) byte {
      switch{
          case '0' <= c && c<='9':
          	return c -'0'
          case 'a' <= c && c<='f':
          	return c - 'a' + 10
          case 'A' <= c && c<='F':
          	return c -"A" +10
      }
      return 0
  }
  ```

  **fallthrough**

  ```go
  //without fallthrough
  switch i{
      case 0:
      case 1:
      	f() //f is called when i == 0
  }
  //with fallthrough
  switch i{
      case 0:	fallthrough
      case 1:
      	f() //f is called when i == 0
  }
  //default
  switch i{
      case 0:
      case 1:
      	f()
      default:
      	g() 	//called when i is not 0 or 1
  }
  //cases can be presented in comma-seperated lists.
  func shouldEscape(c byte) bool {
      switch c{
          case ' ','?','&','=','#','+':  //<= , as "or"
          	return true
      }
      return false
  }
  ```

  A comparison routine for byte arrays that uses two *switch* statements:

  ```go
  func Compare(a,b []byte) int {
      for i:=0; i< len(a) && i <len(b); i++{
          switch{ //@1
              case a[i]>b[i]:
              	return 1
              case a[i]<b[i]:
              	return -1            
          }
      }
      switch { //@2
          case len(a) < len(b):
          	return -1
          case len(a) > len(b):
          	return 1
      }
  }	return 0 //@3
  ```

  1. Compare returns an integer comparing the two byte arrays lexicographically
  2. Strings are equal except for possible tail
  3. Strings are equal

###### Built-in functions

- close

  Used in channel communication, closes an channel.

- delete

  Used for deleting entries in map

- len & cap

  used on a number of different types, len return the length of strings,alices and arrays

- new

  used for allocating memory for user defined data types

- make

  used for allocating memory for built-in types(maps,slices,channels)

- copy

  used for copy slices

- append

  used for concatenating slices

- panic & recover

  used for exception mechanism

- print & println

  low level printing functions that can be used withough reverting to the *fmt* package, mainly for debugging 

- complex, real& imag

  deal with complex numbers

###### Arrays, slices and maps

maps is dictionary or hash type.

- Arrays

  Defined by [n]<type>, where n is the length, and type is the stuff you wanna store.

  ```go
  var arr [10]int
  arr[0] = 43
  arr[1] = 13
  fmt.Printf("The first element is %d\n",arr[0])
  ```

  ```go
  //declare an array that initializes it to soemthing other than zero by using a composite literal
  a := [3]int{1,2,3}
  //or
  a := [...]int{1,2,3} //Go counts elements automatically
  //multidimensional array
  a := [2][2]int{[2]int{1,2},[2]int{1,2}}
  a := [2][2]int{[...]int{1,2},[...]int{1,2}}
  //can futher simplify if the type is identical to the outer literal's element type
  a := [2][2]int{{1,2}, {3,4}}
  
  ```

- Slices

  Similar to array , but can grow when new elements are added.

  It is a **pointer** to an array; reference types. Hence if assign one slice to another, both refer to the same underlying array.

  ```go
  //create a slice which can hold 10 elements
  sl := make([]int,10)
  ```

  A slice is always coupled to an array that has a fixed size.

  ```go
  //create an array of m elements
  var array[m] int
  //create a slice from this array
  slice := array[0:n]
  ```

    Then,

  - len(slice)==n
  - cap(slice)==m
  - len(array)==cap(array)=m		

  ```go
  //array[n:m],creates a slice from array with elements n to m-1
  a := [...]int{1,2,3,4,5} //@1
  s1 := a[2:4] //@2
  s2 := a[1:5] //@3
  s3 := a[:] //@4
  s4 := a[:4] //@5
  s5 := s2[:] //@6
  ```

  1. Defines an array with 5 elements, from index 0 to 4
  2. Create a slice with the elements from index 2 to 3, this contains 3,4
  3. Create a slice with elements from index 1 to 4, this contains 2,3,4,5
  4. Create a slice with all elements of array in it
  5. Create a slice with elements from index 0 to 3, this contains 1,2,3,4
  6. Create a slice from slice s2, still refers to array a though

  Error case:

  ```go
  package main
  
  func main(){
      var array[100]int  //creates an array , index from 0 to 99
      slice := array[0:99] //creates a slice, index from 0 to 98
      
      slice[98] = 'a' //<=OK
      slice[99] = 'a' //<= Error:"throw: index out of range"
  }
  ```

  To extend a slice, use built-in functions

  - append

    ```go
    s0 :=[]int{0,0}
    s1 :=append(s0,2) //@1
    s2 :=append(s1,3,5,7) //@2
    s3 :=append(s2,s0...)//@3 THREE DOTS!!!
    ```

    1. append a single element , s1 == []int{0,0,2}
    2. append multiple elements, s2 ==[]int{0,0,2,3,5,7}
    3. append a slice, s3 ==[]int{0,0,2,3,5,7,0,0}

  - copy

    Function *copy* copies slice elements from *src* to *dst* and return number of elements(n) copied. *src* and *dst* may overlap. 

    $n = min(len(src),len(dst))$

    ```go
    var a = [...]int{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}
    var s = make([]int,6)
    n1 :=copy(s, a[0:]) 
    //above expression results: n1 == 6, s ==[]int{0,1,2,3,4,5}
    n2 :=copy(s, s[2:])
    //above expression results: n2 == 4, s ==[]int{2,3,4,5,4,5}
    ```

- Maps

  Generic way to define map: $map[<from type>]<to type>$

  ```go
  monthdays := map[string]int {
      "jan":31, "Feb":28, "Mar":31,
      "Apr":30, "May":31, "Jun":30,
      "Jul":31, "Aug":31, "Sep":30,
      "Oct":31, "Nov":30, "Dec":31,
  } //comma required
  ```

  NOTEs:

  - Use *make* only when declaring a map: monthdays := make(map[string]int)

  - Use [] for indexing(searching),e.g. fmt.Printf("%d\n", monthdays["Dec"])

  - Use *range* to do the looping

    ```go 
    year := 0 
    for _:days := range monthdays{
       	year += days
    }
    fmt.Printf("Numbers of days in a year:%d\n",year)
    ```

  - Add and delete elements to the map

    ```go
    //add a month
    monthdays["undeci"] = 30
    //overwrite entry
    monthdays["Feb"] = 29
    //Delete "Mar"
    delete(monthdays,"Mar")
    ```

  - Test for existence

    ```go
    var value int
    var present bool
    
    value,present = monthdays["Jan"] //<= present will have value true if value exists
    v,ok = monthdays["Jan"] //<= more Go like form
    
    ```
