#### Beyond the basics

>Go has pointers but not pointer arithmetic. You cannot use a pointer variable to walk through the bytes of a string.

```go
//declare a pointer p which points to an integer value
var p *int
//it prints nil
fmt.Printf("%v",p)

//Delare interger vaiable i
var i int
//Make p points to i
p = &i
//print something like 0x734ff56ac
fmt.Printf("%v",p)
```

De-referencing a pointer is done by prefixing the pointer variable with '*':

```go
p = &i		//takes address of i
*p = 8		//change value of i
fmt.Printf("%v",*p)
fmt.Printf("%v",i)
```

`*p++` is interpreted as `(*p)++`

##### Allocation

Go has garbage collection.

Allocate memory can be done with `new` and `make`.

###### Allocation with new

`new(T)` allocates zeroed storage for a new item of type Y and return its address, a value of type *T. This means a user of the data structure can create one with `new` and get right to work. The zero-value-is-useful property works transitively. 

```go
type SyncedBuffer struct {
    lock sync.Mutex
    buffer bytes.Buffer
}
p:=new(SyncedBuffer)	// Type *SyncedBuffer, ready to use
var v SyncedBuffer		//Type SyncedBuffer,idem
```

###### Allocation with make

`make(T,args)` creates slices,maps, and channels only, and it returns an initialized (not zero) value of type T, not *T. This is because these three types are, **references to data structures** that must be initialized before use. 

e.g. Slice is a three-item descriptor containing a pointer to the data(inside an array), the length, and the capacity; until those items are initialized, the slice is just `nil`.

>- `make(T)` returns an initialized T

>make is only for slices, maps, and channels.



##### Constructors and composite literals

Sometimes zero value is not good enough and an initializing constructor is necessary.

```go
//An example from package os
func NewFile(fd int,name string) *File {
    if fd < 0{
        return nil
    }
    f:=new(File)
    f.fd = fd
    f.name = name
    f.dirinfo =nil
    f.nepipe = 0
    return f
}

//Simplify above using composite literals
func NewFile(fd int,name string) *File {
    if fd < 0 {
        return nil
    }
    f:=File{fd,name,nil,0} //Creates a new File
    return &F	//return the address of F
}
```

It is OK to return the address of a local variable; the storage associated with the variable survives after the function returns.

Taking the address of a s composite literal allocated a fresh instance, so 

```go
return &File{fd, name, nil, 0}
```

The items (called fields) of a composite literal are laid out in order and must all be present. However, by labeling th elements explicitly as field:value pairs, the initializer can appear in any order, with the missing ones left as their respective zero values.

```go
return &File{fd: fd, name:name}
```

If no fields at all,`new(File)` is same as `&File{}`.



Composite literals can also be created for arrays,slices and maps, with the field labels being indices or map keys.

```go
ar := [...]string{Enone:"no error",Einval:"invalid argument"}
sl := []string{Enone:"no error",Einval:"invalid argument"}
ma := map[int]string {Enone:"no error",Einval:"invalid argument"}
```



##### Defining your own types

```go
type foo int
```

New type `foo` acts just like an `int`.

```go
package main
import "fmt"

type NameAge struct {
    name string //not exported
    age int //not exported
}

func main(){
    a:=new(NameAge)
    a.name = "Pete";a.age = 42
    fmt.Printf("%v\n",a)
}
```

###### More on structure fields

Each item in a structure is called a field. 

```go
//struct with no fileds:
struct{}
//with 4 fields
struct {
    x,y int
    A *[]int
    F func()
}
//omit the name, creates anonymous field
struct {
    T1		//Field name is T1
    *T2		//Field name is T2
    P.T3		//Field name is T3
    x,y int		//Field name are x and y
}
```

Fields name start with lowercase are private to current package, with capital letter can be exported. 

###### Methods

Create function that work on your newly defined type:

1. Create a function that takes the type as an argument

   ```go
   //Function call
   func doSomething(n1 *NameAge, n2 int){ /* */ }
   ```

2. Create a function that works on the type

   ```go
   //Method call
   func (n1 *NameAge) doSomething(n2 int){ /* */ }
   //which can be used as
   var n *NameAge
   n.doSomething(2)
   ```

   To satisfy an interface => must use methods

> If x is addressable and &x's method set contains m, `x.m()` is shorthand for `(&x).m()`.

This mean:

```go
var n NameAge
n.doSomething(2)
//above is not an error
```

Difference in type declarations:

```go
type Mutex struct
func (m *Mutex) Lock()
func (m *Mutex) Unlock()

/*1.*/type NewMutex Mutex
/*2.*/type PrintableMutex struct{Mutex }
```

1. `NewMutex` is equal to `Mutex`, but it does not have any of the methods of `Mutex`. Its method set is empty

2. `PrintableMutex` has inherited the method set from `Mutex`. in other words,

   >The method set of `*PrintableMutex` contains the methods `Lock` and` Unlock` bound to its anonymous field `Mutex`

- From a string to a slice of bytes or runes

  ```go
  mystring := "hello this is my string"
  byteslice := []byte(mystring)
  //each byte contains the integer value of the correspoding byte in the //string
  
  runeslice := []rune(mystring)
  //each rune contains a Unicode code point, every character corresponds to //one rune
  ```

- From a slice of bytes or runes to a string

  ```go
  b:= []byte{'h','e','l','l','o'} //composite literal
  s:= string(b)
  i:=[]rune{257,1024,65}
  r:=string(i)
  
  ```

- Numeric values:

  - Convert to an integer with a specific length,e.g.(bit): `uint8(int)`
  - From floating point to an integer:`int(float32)`. It discards fraction part
  - Other way around:` float32(int)`

- User defined types and conversions

  ```go
  type foo struct {int} //anonymous struct field
  type bar foo	//bar is an alias for foo
  //Then
  var b bar = bar {1} //Declare b to be a bar
  var f foo = b 		//Assign b to f, this fails as b (type bar) cannot be //used as type foo
  //hence it should be
  var f foo = (foo)b
  //converting b to plain int will also fail;
  //an integer is not the same as structure containing an integer
  ```
