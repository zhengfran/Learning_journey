Go's ability in concurrent programming lie in **channels** and **goroutines**.

Model of goroutine:

- A function executing in parallel with other goroutines in the same address space

```go
ready("Tea",2) //normal function call
go ready("Tea",2) //ready() started as goroutine
```

Goroutines in actions:

```go
func ready(w string, sec int){
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(sec) * time.Second)
    fmt.Println(w," is ready!")
}

func main(){
    go ready("Tea", 2)
    go ready("Coffee",1)
    fmt.Println("i am waiting")
    time.Sleep(5*time.Second) //@1
}
```

If the @1 line is removed, the program would terminate immediately and any goroutines would die with it. Thus we need some king of mechanism to communicate with the goroutines: *Channels*.

It can e compared to a two-way pipe in Unix shells:can send to and receive values. The values can only be of a specific type: the type of channel. When a channel is defined, the type of value we can send on the channel must also be defined;

```go
ci := make(chan int)
cs := make(chan string)
cf := make(chan interface{})
```

Send and receiving operator is the same. 

```go
ci <- 1 //send interger 1 to channel ci
<- ci //receive an integer from ci
i:=<-ci //receive an terger from ci ans store it in i
```

An improvement to above goroutines using channel:

```go
var c chan int //@1
func ready(w string, sec int){
    time.Sleep(time.Duration(sec)*time.Second)
    fmt.Println(w, "is ready!")
    c <- 1 //@2
}

func main(){
    c = make(chan int) //@3
    go ready ("Tea",2) //@4
    go ready("Coffee",1)
    fmt.Println("I am waiting, but not too long")
    <-c	//@5
    <-c //@6
}
```

1. declare c to be a channel of ints, its  global
2. send 1 on channel c
3. initialize c
4. start goroutines
5. wait until we receive a value from the channel, value is discarded though
6. 2 goroutines, receive 2 values

Another issue: what if we don't know the number of Goroutines?

Use `Select`, which can listen for incoming data on a channel

```go
var i int
//i somethat determins the number of times listening can happens?
L: for {
    select {
        case <-c:
        i++
        if i >1 {
            break L
        }
    }
}
//Yep, when we have received more than one reply on the channel C, we will exit the loop L
```

###### Make it run in parallel

Goroutines were running concurrently, they were not running in parallel. Only one goroutine running at a time.

With `runtime.GOMAXPROC(n)`, you can set the number of goroutines that can run in parallel.

Set an environment variable `GOMAXPROCS` if don't want to change source code.

##### More on channels

`ch := make(chan bool)` creates an unbuffered channel.Meaning:

- (value := <-ch) will block until there is data to receive
- sending `ch<-5` will block until there is somebody to read it

Thus it is a perfect tool for synchronizing multiple goroutines.

`ch:=make(chan bool, 4)` creates a buffered channel of bools that can hold 4 elements.

When first 4 elements are written without any blocking, when write the 5<sup>th</sup> element, it will block until another goroutine read some element from the channel to make room

###### Closing channels

`x, ok = <-ch` check if a channel is closed.

If `ok` is set to false, the channel is closed.
